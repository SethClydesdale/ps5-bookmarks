# PS5 Bookmarks
What is this? It's my personal bookmarks for PS5. I got tired of sending myself links via PSN's messages and decided to just put all my links in one place where they're easy to access; on GitHub. If you'd like to do the same, feel free to fork the repo and remix it to fit your needs.

## How to Use

1. Fork or download the repo.
2. Make edits to the HTML, and stylesheet.css if you want to change colors/layout/images.
3. Push your changes to GitHub. (ignore this if editing via the web)
4. In your PS5 Bookmarks repo on GitHub go to Settings > Pages and build your website from the main branch's root and save.
5. Go to the link once it's published (should be in the current pages tab) and send it to yourself or your second account via https://my.playstation.com/

You're all set! Now you can freely access your bookmarks from the messages and edit them on GitHub whenever you please!
